### learns from earning my first burn  

#### 'this year i was a witness, next year, i'll be a participant.'

no matter how much preparation you do, as a first timer, you will always be a witness. the following is intended to help you be an involved witness, and if called, to be a participant in subsequent years.

i did a tonne of research leading up to my first burn. i scoured reddit for as much useful information as possible, trawled through a plethora of 'packing lists', and spoke to friends that had attended in previous years. despite my efforts, there's still so much i wish i had known and been better prepared for.

first, some thoughts about burning man:
burning man is a place where anyone's inner most desires can be realized. if you can think it, it can become a reality (granted, there are still some limitations eg. physics - but if there are people working on evading these limitations, they're here).
one small caveat: the desire to realize a vision requires that you be willing (and prepared) to navigate the unforgiving elements at play on playa.
in short: you gotta earn the burn.



a group of people all going to war against nature

respect the playa

embrace the dust

hot tip: shave all your body hair. less hair means less surface area for sand to stick to.
i was lucky to have this thought a few days prior and shaved my legs for the first time.
besides the initial itchiness for the first 2 days, mitigated by exfoliating, having no leg hair was a dream on playa.
bumping into something sandy (everything) meant i could simply swipe the dust away.
if you're lucky enough to have access to a shower, you'll be able to dry yourself quicker. which really helps since you want to be as dry as possible when you step back outside.
next year i plan to get waxed a week prior.

men: shave your legs
if first time do so a few days prior and make sure to exfoliate in the subsequent days
I’m going to try getting waxed next year

I never used the portable bidet, different solution required
spray bottle with water
piss jug is so critical

2025 is gonna be fuckn’ different bruv

ebike + lights = self expression
undercover ≠ self expression


#### critical items
- ear plugs
- quality socks (lots)
- dust mask
- spf lip balm
- lightweight footwear
- water proof shoe covers - put on before any contact with wet playa

#### pro moves
- x2 hydration bladders. freeze both, then rotate daily/nightly. pro pro: add 4-5 sachets of electrolytes.
- rear view mirror for (e)bike


Expecting the unexpected is impossible to do, but the unexpected usually takes more time, so give yourself a buffer wherever possible.
Aiming to get to playa on Friday? Aim for Thursday
Aiming to leave reno on Thursday, aim to leave on wed

Worst case scenario, you’ll be way ahead of schedule, which is never a bad thing. And trust, the schedule WILL catch up.

Go to the temple alone, preferably sober.
