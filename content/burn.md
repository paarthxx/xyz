# learns from earning my first burn  


> ## **'this year i was a witness, next year, i'll be a participant'**

no matter how much preparation you do, as a first timer, i feel you will always be a witness. the following is intended to help you be an involved witness, and if called, to be a participant in subsequent years.

**thoughts**  
i did a tonne of research leading up to my first burn. i scoured reddit for as much useful information as possible, trawled through a plethora of 'packing lists', and spoke to friends that had attended in previous years. despite my efforts, there's still so much i wish i had known and been better prepared for.

first, some thoughts about burning man:
burning man is a place where anyone's inner most desires can be realized. if you can think it, it can become a reality (granted, there are still some limitations eg. physics - but if there are people working on evading these limitations, they're here).
one small caveat: the desire to realize a vision requires that you be willing (and prepared) to navigate the unforgiving elements at play on playa.
in short: you will earn your burn.

**tips / hygiene**

shave your whole body. less hair = less surface area = faster ttd (time to dry) if wet, and a general increase in baseline cleanliness
besides the initial itchiness for the first 2 days, mitigated by exfoliating, having no leg hair was a dream on playa.
bumping into something sandy (everything) meant i could simply swipe the dust away.
if first time going hair free, do so a few days prior and make sure to exfoliate for a couple of minutes everyday - it completely mitigates the itching
seriously considering getting waxed next time.

**tips / hygiene / dust**

to deal with alkaline dust, people recommend applying vinegar + water to neuatralize
sounded harsh to me so i went with with hazel + water, and in a spray bottle
spray on the desired area (or everywhere), wipe with wet wipe
I did this before sleeping, and followed with a generous application of sheabutter.

**tips / hygiene / asshole**

I never used the portable bidet I bought, different solution required
maybe a spray bottle with water with a jet feature lmao

**tips / time**

expecting the unexpected is impossible to do, and the unexpected situations usually take an unexpectedly long time, so give yourself a buffer wherever possible.
aiming to get to playa on fri? Aim for thur
aiming to leave reno on thur? Aim to leave on wed

worst case scenario, you’ll be way ahead of schedule, which is never a bad thing. And trust, the schedule WILL catch up.

**tips / tent**

organize your tent. get drawers or hanging things or shelves. living there for a week in a place of complete lack of order, it’s nice to have order in your home
piss jug is so critical for tent, you do not want: sleeping > need to pee > hoes > walk > toilet > walk back > back to sleep - trust

**tips / id**
(e)bike + lights = self expression = go ham on the lights
undercover ≠ self expression.

**tips / pro moves**

if you have access to a freezer, take x2 water bladders, fill both and freeze. Then each day rotate one, so you’ll always have a frozen one available
there is **nothing** like ending a cold night of cycling with a hot sunrise and some icy cold water (pro pro move:  add 4-5 sachets of electrolytes)

rear view mirror for (e)bike. 


**absofruit essentials:**

- earplugs (for music and for sleeping)
- dust mask (maybe one for cycling and one for walking)
- lightweight footwear
- water proof shoe covers - put on before any contact with wet playa, like while still in your tent
- a cord for your sunglasses so it can hang around your neck
- a water bladder (ideally as part of a great backpack)
- quality socks made of natural fibres (wool, cotton / lots)
- spf lip balm


i think this will be a continuously growing document so I’ll refine / add when I get time..

ps. fuck your burn x
