# 2025 is gonna be fuckn’ different bruv / burn learns

> ## **'this year i was a witness, next year i'll be a participant'**

<br>
no matter how much preparation you do, as a first timer, i feel you will always be a witness.<br>
the following is intended to help you be an involved witness, and if called, to be a participant in subsequent years.

i did a tonne of research leading up to my first burn. i scoured reddit for as much useful information as possible, trawled through a plethora of 'packing lists', and spoke to friends that had attended in previous years. despite my efforts, there's still so much i wish i had known and been better prepared for.
below is what i found to be most critical that i didn't find anywhere else, though it's unlikely no one else has thought of them. 


<br>


**thoughts**

first, some thoughts about burning man:
burning man is a place where anyone's inner most desires can be realized. if you can think it, it can become a reality (granted, there are still some limitations eg. physics, though if there are people working on conquering these limitations, they're here).<br>
one small caveat: the desire to realize a vision requires that you be willing (and prepared) to navigate the unforgiving elements at play on playa.<br>
in short: you will earn your burn.


<br>


**thoughts / ethos**

you're undoubtedly already familiar with the [10 principals](https://burningman.org/about/10-principles/), however you may not know that people follow these principals on a spectrum. let's say it's from 0-11.<br>
0 = they don't give a f**k<br>
11 = they're stewards of the principal(s) in the default world.<br>
understanding this nuance will help you manage your expectations, and help in understanding unexpected reactions when you, say, ask someone for help (radical inclusion = 0, radical self-reliance = 10),<br>
or when you see someone treat the playa like their own personal landfill (civic responsibility = 0, leave no trace = 0).


<br>


**tips / hygiene**

shave your whole body. less hair = less surface area = faster ttd (time to dry), and a general increase in baseline cleanliness<br>
if first time going hair free, do so a few days prior.<br>
besides the initial itchiness for the first 2 days, completely mitigated by exfoliating for a couple of minutes everyday, having no body+leg hair was a dream on playa.<br>
bumping into something sandy (everything) meant i could simply swipe the dust away.<br>
seriously considering getting waxed next time.


<br>


**tips / hygiene / dust**

to deal with alkaline dust, people recommend applying vinegar + water to neutralize<br>
sounded harsh to me so i went with witch hazel + water, and in a spray bottle<br>
spray on the desired area (or everywhere), wipe with wet wipe<br>
i did this before sleeping, and followed with a generous application of sheabutter.<br>
tbh my skin was thriving, even more so than usual.


<br>


**tips / hygiene / eyes**

if you wear contact lenses, bring latex/nitrile gloves for taking/putting them in/out<br>
even the cleanest hands aren't sterile.


<br>


**tips / hygiene / asshole**

i never used the portable bidet i bought - different solution required<br>
maybe a water in a spray bottle with a jet feature lmao.


<br>



**tips / time**

expecting the unexpected is impossible to do, and the unexpected situations usually take an unexpectedly long time, so give yourself a buffer wherever possible.<br>
aiming to get to playa on fri? aim for thur. <br>
aiming to leave reno on thur? aim to leave on wed.  

worst case scenario, you’ll be way ahead of schedule, which is never a bad thing. and trust, the schedule ***will*** catch up.


<br>


**tips / time / schedule**

make time to go to the temple<br>
preferably sober. and consider going solo. <br>

understand that you ***will*** miss many of the things you set out to do, especially coz immediacy<br>
some people set out with zero agenda, other's have an elaborate itinerary<br>
the approach i'll be testing next time is to have a destination, while allowing myself to be swept up in whatever happens along the way<br>
i imagine this will give me some sense of 'direction', mitigate feeling aimless, while leaving ample room for serendipity. i could also be totally wrong.


<br>


**tips / tent**

organize your tent. get drawers or hanging things or shelves.<br>
living there for a week in a place of complete lack of order, it’s nice to have order in your home

piss jug is so critical for tent (if you have a vagina: pee funnel).<br>
you do not want: sleeping > need to pee > shoes > walk > pee > walk back > sleep - seriously.


<br>


**tips / id**

(e)bike + lights = self expression = go ham on the lights

undercover ≠ self expression

the orgy dome ***only accepts physical ids***, don't show up unprepared unless you enjoy having blue balls


<br>


**tips / pro moves**

if you have access to a freezer, take x2 hydration packs, fill both and freeze.<br>
then each day rotate one, so you’ll always have a frozen one available.<br>
there is ***nothing*** like ending a night of cycling with a hot sunrise and some icy cold water<br>
pro pro move:  add 4-5 sachets of [electrolytes](https://drinklmnt.com).

next year i'm planning on getting a rear view mirror for my (e)bike, for keeping track of the gang
and probably an led pole/totem so it's easier to find.<br>


<br>

**absofruit essentials:**

- earplugs (for [music](https://www.earpeace.com/products/music-earplugs?srsltid=AfmBOopBT1oMBSt0o9edy9mjAdCPffVi97jPNxZ6yPGePovGvrLGwwbh) and for [sleeping](https://a.co/d/1uMEb0b))
- dust mask (maybe one for cycling and one for walking)
- lightweight footwear
- water proof shoe covers - put on before any contact with wet playa, like while still in your tent
- a [cord for your sunglasses](https://a.co/d/8SkrU7T) so they can hang around your neck
- a hydration pack (ideally as part of a great [backpack](https://a.co/d/elNeBa4))
- quality socks made of natural fibres (wool, cotton / lots)
- [spf lip balm](https://a.co/d/9a8PT9h)


<br>

i think this will be a continuously growing document so I’ll refine / add when i get time..
